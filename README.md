### Project report

-- ABSTRACT -- 


## Repository Overview:
architecture: Contains subclasses inhereting from tf.keras.Model. Those are the models we are training
data: Train and test data taken from the Bremen Big Data Challenge 2018 (https://bbdc.csl.uni-bremen.de/index.php/2018h/23-aufgabenstellung-2018)
data_statistics: Some statistics about the data. For example correlations between the variables. Seperated into test and train data statistics. 
figures: Figures used in our report
logs: Training logs and model summaries when searching for hyperparameters
predictions: Wind energy output predictions the best model from each architecture
